EPDN: Structural-preserving Speckle Denoising for Wafer Surface Phase Images via Hybrid NLM-Enhanced U-Net CGAN
This repository provides the PyTorch implementation of the Enhanced Phase Denoising Network (EPDN). EPDN is a novel Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) framework specifically designed for speckle denoising of wafer surface phase maps in Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM). Our model effectively removes coherent speckle noise while preserving crucial structural features.
Core Features and Innovations
This project integrates three main technical innovations, derived from the paper, to achieve state-of-the-art denoising performance on complex patterned surfaces:
1.Hybrid NLM Enhancement (Auxiliary Input): We innovatively incorporate the features from Non-Local Means (NLM) pre-denoised phase maps as an auxiliary third input channel to the U-Net Generator. This significantly boosts the network's ability to utilize non-local similarity and enhance denoising performance.
2.Tailored Composite Loss Function: The training utilizes a sophisticated loss function, combining $\text{L1}/\text{SSIM}$ loss, Gradient Loss, Phase MSE Loss, and GAN Adversarial Loss. The Gradient Loss and Phase MSE Loss are calculated directly on the original phase values ($\phi_{gt}$), ensuring superior preservation of phase structure.
3.Structural-preserving Inference Strategy: For real-world large-scale DHM images, we employ an Overlap-Tile Strategy with Gaussian Blending (as seen in EPDN-test.py). This post-processing mechanism is critical for eliminating the visible stitching artifacts that commonly occur when processing large images via deep learning patches.
